ScottGeek Tech site and blog [on ScottGeek.Technology](https://scottgeek.technology)

### General Rules

Fork/Copy/Read - the docs are a collection make of them as you choose. The only rule here is don't push blame or meaness in or around my repos. If you find no value here, then it is simple.... MOVE ON. If find value, then I would have succeeded at a modest goal.
